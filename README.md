####Project Overview
Weekend Wanderlust is an interactive map for weekend explorers in San Francisco Bay Area. 
It maps upcoming weekend events, uncovers hidden-gems nearby, provides routing estimates and real-time updated information to help users plan smarter for their weekend adventures. Hidden-gems are noteable local businesses or unique spots, they are "hidden" by default, users can discover them by clicking on an event, typing an address, using current location or activating the "Explorer Circle" - all will lead to a more detailed map displaying hidden-gems within 1 mile, tips & photos from Foursquare users and normal/popular hours - and you will never get bored by discovering more.
