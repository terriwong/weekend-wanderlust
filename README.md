####Project Overview
Weekend Wanderlust is an interactive map for weekend explorers in San Francisco Bay Area. It maps upcoming weekend events, uncovers hidden-gems nearby, provides routing estimates and realtime updated information to help users plan for their weekend adventures. Hidden-gems are local businesses or unique spots that worth visiting if you are around. They are "hidden" by default, users can discover them by clicking on an event, typing an address, using current location or activating the "Explorer Circle" to sweep around - all will lead to a more detailed map showing hidden-gems within 1 mile, tips & photos, and normal/popular hours. User can save trip notes via sms for handy info on the go - and you will never get bored by discovering more.
